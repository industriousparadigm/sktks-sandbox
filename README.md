# NextJS Starter Styled Components

A starter kit mostly for personal use, since I end up doing a lot of these tweaks every time I start a project with NextJS.

Tweaks include:

- Styled components
- Meyer's CSS reset
- Some global styles via GlobalStyle.js
- Some pre-styled components via DesignSystem.js
- ESLint & Prettier
- Absolute imports
